# kernelshap 0.9.0 (MAJOR BUG FIX)

We have figured out a major bug in the weighting logic of Kernel SHAP.

This update comes with a fix which has been tested also against different
Python algorithms.

I know that summer holidays are ahead, and the last release is not long ago, 
but I would love to see this change on CRAN very soon.

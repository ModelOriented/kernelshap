# kernelshap 0.9.0

We have figured out a bug in the weighting logic of Kernel SHAP.

This update comes with a fix which has been tested against two other implementations.

I am aware that the last release of {kernelshap} is not too long ago, but I still would love to see
this fixed before the (well-deserved) summer break.

Thanks a lot!

# kernelshap 1.0.0

- We have fixed a problematic bug in the weighting logic of Kernel SHAP.
- Better parallel processing via {future.apply}.

I am aware that the last release of {kernelshap} is not too long ago, but I still would love to see
this fixed before your (well-deserved) summer break.

Thanks a lot!

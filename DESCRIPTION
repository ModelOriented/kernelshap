Description: Efficient implementation of Kernel SHAP, see Lundberg and Lee
    (2017) <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3295222.3295230>, and Covert
    and Lee (2021) <http://proceedings.mlr.press/v130/covert21a>.  For
    models with up to eight features, the results are exact regarding the
    selected background data.  Otherwise, an almost exact hybrid algorithm
    involving iterative sampling is used.  The package plays well together
    with meta-learning packages like 'tidymodels', 'caret' or 'mlr3'.
    Visualizations can be done using the R package 'shapviz'.

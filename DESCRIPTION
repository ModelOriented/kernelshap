Description: Efficient implementation of Kernel SHAP (Lundberg and Lee,
    2017, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1705.07874>) permutation SHAP, and additive
    SHAP for model interpretability.  For Kernel SHAP and permutation
    SHAP, if the number of features is too large for exact calculations,
    the algorithms iterate until the SHAP values are sufficiently precise
    in terms of their standard errors.  The package integrates smoothly
    with meta-learning packages such as 'tidymodels', 'caret' or 'mlr3'.
    It supports multi-output models, case weights, and parallel
    computations.  Visualizations can be done using the R package
    'shapviz'.
